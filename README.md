# **Hello, World**

This repository contains my assignment for Bootstrap Forms, Module 9 Lesson 5.

Overview:

For this assignment I used the 'assignment.html' file to create 3 forms using Bootstrap, and its various classes, to design and style each form.

Tasks Completed:

Part 1 Task 1: The first form design on the 'assignment.html' file, this form was designed to place the user input sections into 2 columns for
large and medium screens.

Part 1 Task 2: This is the 2nd form design on the 'assignment.html' file, found on code line 69. This form was designed as an inline form
with all user input fields inline horizontally, including the submit button.

Part 1 Task 3: This is the last form design on the 'assignment.html' file, found on code line 101. This form was designed to have the input 
fields stack on top of each other, and with the label for each input field to be found above the input field.

Part 2 Task 1 was to style the forms using Bootstrap classes. Each of the 3 forms is designed to display uniquely.
